//- Have a canvas HTML element

//- Have 3 preset colors of your choice (to the left of the canvas)

//- Allow the user to select any of the three colors and use some form of CSS (in this case the white border around red) to show which
//color is selected

//- On mouse down on the canvas, start drawing on the canvas until the user releases the mouse or leaves the canvas. The color of the line
//should correspond to the selected color on the right.

//- At the bottom have three sliders representing red green and blue, they should allow for a numerical value from 0-255.

//When the sliders are moved, the color in the box to the left of the sliders (in this case the purplish box) should adjust color
//according to the new `rgb()` values;

//- When a user clicks add color, it should add the new color to the bottom of the other color buttons and be able to be selected
//for use on the canvas.

//- Feel free to add more functionality, such as a way to clear the canvas, change the stroke size, add a better cursor etc.
